# Library-Database
A Mockup of a library system for practice in creating relational databases, while also cataloging my personal collection of books.

# Version: 1.0
Version release date: Aug, 2024

# Technologies Used
- SQL
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

# What I Learned
This project was created to allow me to test and practice setting up a local server in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to allow for a database to run and house data for my programming projects. It was a great refresher on SQL as well, and also for creating an entity relationship diagram to plan out the tables and their data.

I learned to:
- Install and setup SQL Server Management Studio
- Create a local database
- Create and query a small database with queries including:
    - SELECT statements
    - etc.
